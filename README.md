# Learner Clustering Web App  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This Streamlit-based web application clusters learners based on various features, helping educational institutes optimize their marketing strategies and target the right audience effectively.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Supports **default datasets** and **custom dataset uploads**  
- **Dynamic feature selection** (users can choose relevant features)  
- Multiple clustering evaluation methods:  
  - **Dendrogram**  
  - **Silhouette Score**  
  - **Elbow Method**  
  - **Davies-Bouldin Score**  
- **Interactive Visualizations** (PCA, UMAP for 2D clustering representation)  
- Handles large datasets (**up to 50,000 records**) efficiently  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, UMAP, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Machine Learning** (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, UMAP)  
- **Streamlit** (for interactive UI and deployment)
